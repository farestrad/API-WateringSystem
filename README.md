# watering-systen
This project is an application programming interface (API) between Java and Arduino to make an automatic plant watering system. The system uses the Arduino Uno starter kit to water the plants. Once the sensor feels the sand is dry it starts the pump by itself and stops it when it is wet.  
The code makes one of buttons on the Kit turn on the pump by hand as well.
The code makes a graph between the Arduino and Java.
Finally, the buzzer works when needed.
please note that I wrote each code separately in this project, you can view both Java and Arduino codes.
