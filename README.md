# watering-systen
this proejct is an application programming interface (API) between Java and Arduino in order to make a plant watering system.
the system water a plant using Aruidno Uno beginner kit. It does it automatically, once the sensor feels the sand is dry it starts the pump by itself and stops it when it is wet.
the code has a java button which turns on the pump by hand as well.
the code makes a graph between the arduino and java.
and finally the buzzer works in case needed.
please note that I wrote each code iseperatly in this project, you can view both java and arduino codes
